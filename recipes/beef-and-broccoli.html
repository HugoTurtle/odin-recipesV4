        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Beef and Broccoli is an easy, 1-pan, 30-minute meal that is loaded with 
            fresh broccoli, tender nutrition-packed beef, and the best stir fry sauce.
            Beef is delicious and protein-packed to give you the sustained strength you 
            need to get through the back to school season. We also made sure to add plenty of 
            broccoli for a balanced meal. Beef is so versatile for stir fry. You can add your 
            favorite vegetables to this recipe like snap peas, bell peppers, carrots, and even mushrooms.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup oyster sauce</li>
            <li>⅓ cup sherry</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>¾ pound beef round steak, cut into 1/8-inch thick strips</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more if needed</li>
            <li>1 thin slice of fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
            <li>1 pound broccoli, cut into florets</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk oyster sauce, sherry, sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl; stir until sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Place steak in a shallow bowl. Pour oyster sauce mixture over meat and stir to coat; cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add ginger and garlic; let sizzle for about 1 minute to flavor oil, then remove and discard. Stir in broccoli. Toss and stir until bright green and almost tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove broccoli from the wok and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add a little more oil to the wok, if needed, then add beef with marinade. Stir and toss until sauce thickens and turns shiny and meat is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Return broccoli to the wok; stir until heated through, about 3 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
